# Typescript

Typescript it's not a language or stand alone language. And why not? Because it's too dependent of javascript.

In short Typescript is all about, **TYPE SAFETY**. More precisely and accurate way to code.

### What typescript does?

The only job is: _STATIC CHECKING_.

### Typescript is a development tool!

Yes, it is! That's the reason that ou use **--save-dev** to install typescript into your project.
E.g.:
<code>
npm install typescript --save-dev
</code>

In the end, your project still runs JS!

In other words, Typescript is a tool that helps you to write a better javascript code.
